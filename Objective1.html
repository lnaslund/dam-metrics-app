&amp; Macmullan 2002</a>). Implementation cost includes the cost of
removing or repairing the dam and appurtenant structures, permitting
costs, and mitigation costs (<a href="https://www.rff.org/publications/issue-briefs/funding-options-dam-removal-united-states/">Walls

all incur implementation costs.</p>
<p><strong>1b. Minimize maintenance cost</strong>: Ongoing capital
investment required to support the management decision is also a
critical component of cost-benefit analysis.</p>
