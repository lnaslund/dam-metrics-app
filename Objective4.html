<p><strong>4a. Maximize swift water recreational opportunities</strong>:
Dam removal can increase the recreational use of the river and
surrounding landscape, particularly for swift-water based recreation
like rafting and tubing (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2000WR000136">Loomis et al. 2002</a>, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/rec.13500">Leisher
et al. 2021</a>)</p>
<p><strong>4b. Maximize flat water recreational opportunities</strong>:
Recreation is the most common primary purpose of dams in the National
Inventory of Dams, accounting for 32% of primary purposes among all
structures; however, dams that no longer serve their intended purpose
are frequently assigned recreation as their primary purpose in the NID
(<a href="https://www.rff.org/publications/reports/dams-and-dam-removals-united-states/">Gonzales
&amp; Walls 2020</a>).</p>
<p><strong>4c. Minimize adverse impacts to sites judged by the
community, state, or Nation to be historically significant
places</strong>: Historically significant sites are frequently subject
to conservation measures under the National Historic Preservation Act
and state and tribal equivalent laws (<a href="https://www.americanrivers.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Dam_Removal_and_Historic_Preservationa3eb.pdf">McClain
et al 2008</a>). Even sites without formal recognition may be important
to a community’s historic memory (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geoforum.2016.02.013">Fox et
al. 2016</a>).</p>
<p><strong>4d. Minimize interruption to community sense of
place</strong>: Opposition to dam removals is often fomented by the
entangling of “regional identity, history, and personal experience” that
make dams become symbols of community identity (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geoforum.2016.02.013">Fox et
al. 2016</a>).</p>
