taxa</strong>: Promote/maintain an organism or group of organisms of
interest: By fragmenting critical habitats and altering the flow of
water and sediment, dams can promote the decline of freshwater
organisms, like migratory fish and freshwater mussels (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/icb/33.6.599">Bogan 1993</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1525/bio.2009.59.11.7">Limburg &amp; Waldman
2009</a>). Dam removal can be a critical component of conservation
efforts. This may be a particularly salient objective of dam removal
when the organism under consideration is afforded protection under the
Endangered Species Act or another legal mechanism (e.g., treaty rights)
(<a href="https://doi.org/10.1641/0006-3568(2002)052%5B0739:LPODR%5D2.0.CO;2">Bowman
2002</a>).</p>
<p><strong>5b. Promote/maintain biodiversity</strong>: Dams have been
implicated in the loss of biodiversity in freshwater ecosystems and
restoring connectivity through dam removal and retrofit has been
identified as a key step for freshwater biodiversity recovery (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/biosci/biaa002">Tickner et
al. 2020</a>).</p>
<p><strong>5c. Prevent the spread of invasive species, disease, or
undesirable hybridization</strong>: The restriction of aquatic organism
by dams can be leveraged in conservation scenarios in which increasing
river network access of a species or population is undesirable because
it would spread disease, promote undesirable hybridization between
populations (e.g., farmed and wild salmon), or because the species is
invasive (e.g., lamprey in the Great Lakes) (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/faf.12003">McLaughlin et al. 2013</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10980-014-0114-z">Melles et
al. 2015</a>).</p>
<p><strong>5d. Reduce greenhouse gas emissions</strong>: Reservoirs
created by dams can be relatively large sources of greenhouse gas
emissions to the atmosphere. In flooding terrestrial soils and
vegetation dams can convert land from a carbon dioxide sink to a carbon
dioxide source. Dams also concentrate organic matter in their sediments,
creating a high demand for oxygen which is consumed in the breakdown of
organic matter. When sediments are depleted of oxygen, organisms called
methanogens can break down organic matter to produce methane: a potent
greenhouse gas which has 28 times the warming potential of carbon
dioxide (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/biosci/biw117">Deemer et
al. 2016</a>). Dam removal may reduce methane emissions by reducing the
frequency of conditions conducive for methane production and emission
and by facilitating the establishment of a carbon dioxide sink through
uptake by terrestrial vegetation.</p>
<p><strong>5e. Maintain or improve water quality</strong>: Removing a
dam alters the physical and chemical characteristics of the aquatic
ecosystem which control the dispersal of sediment and toxins, oxygen
dynamics, nutrient availability, and the risk of harmful algal blooms
(<a href="https://doi.org/10.1890/1540-9295(2003)001%5B0015:TOTEEO%5D2.0.CO;2">Stanley
and Doyle 2003</a>; <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2014.06.025">Oliver et
al. 2014</a>).</p>
<p><strong>5f. Reduce stream geomorphic degradation</strong>: Dam
removal can release impounded water and sediment downstream, which
drives context-dependent changes in geomorphology, including triggering
a years-long pattern of reservoir erosion and downstream deposition that
has hydroecological effects (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/9781118971437.ch13">Major et
al. 2017</a>). In a system previously destabilized by sediment trapping
and experiencing migrating headcuts, restoring sediment connectivity can
avoid downstream bank failures which would have occurred through channel
incision.</p>
