<p><strong>2a. Meet water demands</strong>: In 2015, withdrawals from
fresh surface water, including streams, lakes, and reservoirs, accounted
for over 60% of total water withdrawals in the US in 2015 (198 billion
gallons/day), with the most substantial withdrawals for thermoelectric
power, irrigation, and public supply (<a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/circ/1441/circ1441.pdf">Dieter et
al. 2018</a>).</p>
<p><strong>2b. Meet power demands</strong>: Hydropower accounted for
6.3% of power generation in the US in 2021 and is used extensively to
provide short-term ramping flexibility (<a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2021/01/f82/us-hydropower-market-report-full-2021.pdf">Uría-Martínez
et al. 2021</a>, <a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=427&amp;t=3">U.S. EIA
2022</a>).</p>
<p><strong>2c. Meet navigational demands</strong>: The US government
maintains more than 200 locks and dams within its 12,000 miles of inland
and intracoastal waterways, making these structures important conduits
for commercial navigation (<a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF11593">Carter and
Fritelli 2020</a>). Some dams are also critical terrestrial
transportation structures, with major roads that traverse the dam, such
as US 93 which previously crossed the Hoover Dam.</p>
<p><strong>2d. Minimize flood risk</strong>: Flood control is the
primary use for approximately 20% of the dams listed in the National
Inventory of Dams (<a href="https://www.publications.usace.army.mil/Portals/76/Publications/EngineerPamphlets/EP_360-1-23.pdf">USACE
2016</a>). This amounts to roughly 16,000 dams. Removal may increase
flood risk for downstream floodplain communities that developed with the
security afforded by the dam (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-76158-3">Habel et
al. 2020</a>; <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/2016WR019905">Ho et
al. 2017</a>).</p>
