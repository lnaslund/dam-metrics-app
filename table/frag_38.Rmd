# Erosion potential
Erosion potential assesses the susceptibility of the stream to erode based on the amount of sediment available and the streamâ€™s ability to move that sediment. This is imperative to understanding potential geomorphic channel change that may result from dam decommissioning.

## Data requirements/sources
Streamflow data from [USGS](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/rt); sediment size and distributions; suspended sediment concentrations
