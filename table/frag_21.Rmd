# Risk of spread

Like other connectivity-based metrics, risk of spread methods vary in biological complexity. 

* Binary indicator of whether an invasive species, disease, or source population for undesirable hybrids is located upstream or downstream of a given dam
* Invasion risk estimated as the product of the probability of movement through and suitability of a given reach for the invasive species, disease or undesirable source population


## Data requirements/sources
Locations of invasive organisms, infected populations, or source population for undesirable hybrids and geospatial model of the river network (e.g., [NHDPlus](https://www.usgs.gov/national-hydrography/nhdplus-high-resolutio))
