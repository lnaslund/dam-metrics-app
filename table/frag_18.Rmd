# Connectivity methods
Connectivity methods are similar in form to single organism metrics decribed in objective 5a. 

Variations include metrics which: 

* Account for the hydrologic complexity of unfragmented portions of the river network (e.g., # of Strahler orders represented)
* Prioritize connectivity among sites with high habitat assessment scores

Note that flow intermittency may be an important consideration in calculating connectivity, particularly in dryland rivers ([Marshall et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2021.671556)).

## Data requirements/sources
Geospatial model of the river network (e.g., [NHDPlus](https://www.usgs.gov/national-hydrography/nhdplus-high-resolutio)), including the Strahler order attribute; habitat scores of reaches
