<p>The impact of dam removal on property values is not well-understood.
Several hedonic analyses have indicated no impact of small dam removals
on property values (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1465-7287.2008.00107.x" target="_blank">Provencher et al. 2008</a>; <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/09640568.2024.2322538" target="_blank">Cahill &amp; Anguelov 2024</a>), while some have
indicated a positive effects (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1465-7287.2008.00100.x" target="_blank">Lewis et al. 2008</a>; <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wre.2017.02.001" target="_blank">Lewis
&amp; Landry 2017</a>). The impact of large dam removals on property
values is likely greater than that of small removals but empirical
evidence is lacking.</p>
<p>Other studies have found a strong perception among riparian residents
that dam removal will decrease the value of their lakefront homes (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2008.07.027" target="_blank">Wyrick et al. 2009</a>), indicating that perceived loss
of property value with dam removal would also manifest through riparian
resident opposition to dam removal which is a metric outlined for
objective 4d) Minimize interruption to community sense of place.</p>
