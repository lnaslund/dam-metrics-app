# Connectivity metrics

## Data requirements/sources
Connectivity metrics like those described for objectives 5a and 5b can be adapted to represent swiftwater connectivity for recreators.

These metrics can be adapted by accounting for:

* water quality
* distance from other recreational amenities
* flow

### Relevant data

Stream map ([NHD](https://www.usgs.gov/national-hydrography/nhdplus-high-resolution)), dam location data ([NID](https://nid.usace.army.mil/#/) or other database), water quality data ([NWIS](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis), state, or local databases), location of recreational amenities (parks and recreation departments, county GIS services)
