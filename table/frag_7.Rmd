# Connectivity metrics

## Data requirements/sources
Connectivity metrics like those described for objectives 5a and 5b can be adapted to represent swiftwater connectivity for recreators.

These metrics can be adapted by accounting for:

* water quality
* distance from other recreational amenities
* flow

### Relevant data

Stream map ([NHD](https://www.usgs.gov/national-hydrography/nhdplus-high-resolution){target="_blank"}), dam location data ([NID](https://nid.sec.usace.army.mil/#/){target="_blank"} or other database), water quality data ([NWIS](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis){target="_blank"}, state, or local databases), location of recreational amenities (parks and recreation departments, county GIS services)
