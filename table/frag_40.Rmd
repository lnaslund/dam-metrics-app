# Replacement infrastructure cost estimate

Dam removals are sometimes accompanied by the construction of supplanting infrastructure to replace the services provided by the dam. Examples include flood protection (levees, bank protection, flood protection settlements) or water supply infrastructure. With this estimate, the user can determine the total cost of dam removal without disruption to services provided by the dam.
