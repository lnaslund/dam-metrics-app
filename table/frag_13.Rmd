# Number of properties proximate to reservoir

This method is a conservative approach to estimating local opposition to dam removal by assuming that property owners near reservoirs are likely to oppose dam removal and overall opposition scales with the number of property owners proximate to a reservoir. 

## Data requirements/sources
Parcel maps are frequently available from the county tax assessorsâ€™ office to determine the number of properties within a discrete distance to a reservoir. The appropriate distance scales with reservoir size.
