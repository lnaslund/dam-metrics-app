# Current water quality

Modeled (e.g., [SPARROW](https://www.usgs.gov/mission-areas/water-resources/science/sparrow-modeling-estimating-nutrient-sediment-and-dissolved){target="_blank"}) or measured water quality can be used to prioritize sites with water quality issues that may be ameliorated by dam removal (e.g., high temperature, chlorophyll, or low dissolved oxygen).

## Data requirements/sources
Identification of impaired waters (e.g., 303d list), water quality model inputs or measured water quality parameters
