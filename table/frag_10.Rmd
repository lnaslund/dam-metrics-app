# Accessible flat water area (km^2^)

## Data requirements/sources
Area of flat water can be discerned from a map of waterbodies ([NHD](https://www.usgs.gov/national-hydrography/nhdplus-high-resolution){target="_blank"}, or other database). 

Area metric can be modified to account for water quality and the location of other recreational amenities that affect flat water accessibility (water quality data: [NWIS](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis){target="_blank"}, state, or local databases), location of recreational amenities (parks and recreation departments, county GIS services).
