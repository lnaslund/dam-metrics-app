<h1>Number of properties proximate to reservoir</h1>
<p>This method is a conservative approach to estimating local opposition
to dam removal by assuming that property owners near reservoirs are
likely to oppose dam removal and overall opposition scales with the
number of property owners proximate to a reservoir.</p>
<div id="data-requirementssources" class="section level2">
<h2>Data requirements/sources</h2>
<p>Parcel maps are frequently available from the county tax assessorsâ€™
