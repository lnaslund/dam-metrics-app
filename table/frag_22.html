<h1>Estimated landscape greenhouse gas balance</h1>
<p>Landscape greenhouse gas balance (here defined as greenhouse gas
balance from the reservoir impounded area) is generally estimated using
measurements from similar systems. Most estimates of reservoir
greenhouse gas emissions quantify CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub>
emissions only, as nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) is responsible for an
average of only 4% of the radiative forcing from reservoirs (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/biosci/biw117" target="_blank">Deemer et
al. 2016</a>). Tools like <a href="https://131.datatrium.com/fmi/webd/G-res%20Tool?script=ChoiceWebPage&amp;param=Grestool&amp;homeurl=https://g-res.hydropower.org" target="_blank">g-res</a> are useful for estimating greenhouse gas
emissions attributable to the reservoir while it is impounded. To
estimate the change in landscape greenhouse gas balance following dam
removal, many other gas sources and sinks in the reservoir footprint
should be accounted for including: soil CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, river
CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, tree CO<sub>2</sub> uptake, soil
CH<sub>4</sub> uptake, river CH<sub>4</sub> emissions, tree
CH<sub>4</sub> emissions, as well as the transitional emissions from
decomposition of newly exposed organic matter in the former reservoir
sediments.</p>
<p>For hydropower dams, carbon intensity–CO<sub>2</sub>-eq emissions per
unit electricity generated–may be an appropriate method important for
evaluating the environmental impact of hydropower generation at a
particular dam.</p>
