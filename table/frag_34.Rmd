# Submerged hydraulic jumps

Proportion of annual flows classified as dangerous submerged hydraulic jumps (tailwater depth > conjugate depth; discharge lower than the flip point; velocity greater than average swimming speed)

## Data requirements/sources
Streamflow data from [USGS](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/rt) to calculate flow statistics; spreadsheet from [Wahl & Svoboda (2022)](https://ascelibrary.org/doi/abs/10.1061/9780784484258.026) to estimate dangerous flows; HEC-RAS models for detailed assessments (may be publicly available for many larger rivers)
